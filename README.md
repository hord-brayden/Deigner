# 🕵️‍♂️ Deigner - The Over-Engineered, Poorly-Coded Ad Inspector

A basic bid examination tool for exploring marketing calls and requests, makes a popup on the page where it's launched, and is built to inform and advise.

Because sometimes you need to know way too much about the ads stalking you across the internet.

## What is This Monstrosity?

Deigner (*dayn-errr*) (pronounced however you want, we're not picky) is a Chrome extension that helps you peek behind the curtain of digital advertising. It's like having x-ray vision for ads, except instead of seeing through walls, you're seeing through layers of JavaScript and network requests. Also much like x-rays, if you spend too much time with it, you might get cancer.

## Features That May or May Not Work

### 🎯 Prebid.js Analysis
- Stalks your Prebid.js implementation like an overly attached ex
- Shows you all the bidders fighting over your precious ad slots
- Exposes bid prices because apparently, that's not supposed to be private

### 🌊 Amazon TAM Whisperer
- Tries really hard to understand Amazon's TAM (Transparent Ad Marketplace)
- "Transparent" is a strong word here, but I do my best
- Sometimes catches bids, sometimes catches feelings

### 🕸️ Network Traffic Stalker
- Captures ad-related network requests like Pokemon
- Probably uses too much memory
- But hey, at least you can see what's slowing down your browser!

### 🎭 User Targeting Inspector
- Shows you how advertisers think they know you
- Spoiler alert: They think you're really into whatever you last googled
- Prepare to question every online purchase you've ever made

### 🆔 ID Detective
- Exposes all the ways you're being tracked
- Warning: May cause existential crisis about digital privacy
- At least now you know why you keep seeing ads for that one thing you looked at once

## Contributing

If you want to? Sure I guess?
(Just kidding, PRs welcome, but please maintain the same level of questionable code organization and unnecessary complexity - I have standards here, it's called class sweety 💅🏻)

## Credits

- Built by someone who spent way too much time looking at ads
- Special thanks to the ads that inspired this tool by being particularly annoying

## License

MIT License (because we're brave enough to let you see our mistakes) - tell me if you use this in anything mostly because it'd be cool to see!!

## Final Notes

If you find this useful, you probably work in ad tech and we're sorry. If you find bugs, they're definitely features. If you understand all the code, please explain it to us.

Remember:
